Metro Travel Solution - Algorithm Based Travel Solution in Metropolitan Cities.

After the Indian government announced its new smart city plans, many big cities have been given the task of planning their metro system. In the initial stages of the creation of a new metro system, travelling can be quite hectic. In order to make metro transportation easier for the common people, we have devised an optimal solution. To help travelers, find the shortest route between two stations, determine the cost of travelling, and perform other tasks, we have developed an integrated Metro Travel Solution.
